/******************* HIV ******************/
/*
 * LOGIC:
 * I have to look for any 2 instances of:
 * any lab that contains HIV with a positive result during pregnancy prior to the ultrasound
 * any lab with HIV RNA Quant with a positive result during pregnancy prior to the ultrasound
 * HIV RNA Quant ordered more than once (no matter the result?â€‹) during pregnancy prior to the ultrasound. Yes, because a patient could have an undetectable viral load through the whole pregnancy so it could always be negative. And this is just one criteria, because they need two instances.
 * 2 instances of ICD diagnoses codes logged during pregnancy prior to the ultrasound
 * Any medication ordered prior to the ultrasound.
